   <p>Hello, my name is Serena Yu.
    Hello everyone, my name is Serena Yu. i am currently a sophomore majoring in Communication Design. I'm trying to learn how to code websites, and although it's a new and hard thing for me to do, I'm finding it very interesting! I hope I can have a great time in this class with my fellow CD majors.</p>
    
   <p> I think that design that has the best foundtion and has nothing to add or subtract is the ultimate purpose of design, and I think it is also the direction that I should pursue in the future.</p>
